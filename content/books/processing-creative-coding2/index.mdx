The authors write, "If you’ve been curious about coding, but the thought of it also makes you nervous, this book is for you; if you consider yourself a creative person, maybe worried programming is too non-creative, this book is also for you; if you want to learn about the latest Processing 2.0 language release and also start making beautiful code art, this book is also definitely for you. Based on research funded by the National Science Foundation, this book brings together some of the most engaging and successful approaches from the digital arts and computer science classrooms:

- Learn the latest features of Processing 2.0
- Gain a solid understanding of coding concepts, such as design, analysis, and object-oriented programming
- Generate algorithmic art
- Code 2D and 3D interactive animations
- Create a visualization based on big data"
