  "paragraph": "This library provides easy ways to connect a Processing sketch to an OOCSI server and communicate through this connection with other clients on many different platforms, such as Processing, Java, Android, Python, OSC, and HTML/JavaScript and Node.js via web sockets. Processing sketches can not only send and receive messages between specific clients, but also broadcast and subscribe to channels, which makes coordinating a large number of sketches or devices surprisingly simple and robust.",
