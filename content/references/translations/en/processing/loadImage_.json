  "description": "Loads an image into a variable of type <b>PImage</b>. Four types of images\n ( <b>.gif</b>, <b>.jpg</b>, <b>.tga</b>, <b>.png</b>) images may be loaded.\n To load correctly, images must be located in the data directory of the\n current sketch.<br/>\n <br/>\n In most cases, load all images in <b>setup()</b> to preload them at the\n start of the program. Loading images inside <b>draw()</b> will reduce the\n speed of a program. Images cannot be loaded outside <b>setup()</b> unless\n they're inside a function that's called after <b>setup()</b> has already\n run.<br/>\n <br/>\n Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer\n using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or\n a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a\n file found on a network.<br/>\n <br/>\n If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will be\n returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error\n message does not halt the program, however the <b>null</b> value may cause a\n NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned\n is <b>null</b>.<br/>\n <br/>\n The <b>extension</b> parameter is used to determine the image type in cases\n where the image filename does not end with a proper extension. Specify the\n extension as the second parameter to <b>loadImage()</b>, as shown in the\n third example on this page. Note that CMYK images are not supported.<br/>\n <br/>\n Depending on the type of error, a <b>PImage</b> object may still be\n returned, but the width and height of the image will be set to -1. This\n happens if bad image data is returned or cannot be decoded properly.\n Sometimes this happens with image URLs that produce a 403 error or that\n redirect to a password prompt, because <b>loadImage()</b> will attempt to\n interpret the HTML as image data.",
