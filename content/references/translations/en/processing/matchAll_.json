  "description": "This function is used to apply a regular expression to a piece of text,\n and return a list of matching groups (elements found inside parentheses)\n as a two-dimensional String array. If there are no matches, a <b>null</b>\n value will be returned. If no groups are specified in the regular\n expression, but the sequence matches, a two-dimensional array is still\n returned, but the second dimension is only of length one.<br/>\n <br/>\n To use the function, first check to see if the result is <b>null</b>. If the\n result is null, then the sequence did not match at all. If the sequence did\n match, a 2D array is returned.<br/>\n <br/>\n If there are groups (specified by sets of parentheses) in the regular\n expression, then the contents of each will be returned in the array.\n Assuming a loop with counter variable i, element [i][0] of a regular\n expression match returns the entire matching string, and the match groups\n start at element [i][1] (the first group is [i][1], the second [i][2], and\n so on).<br/>\n <br/>\n The syntax can be found in the reference for Java's <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html\">Pattern</a>\n class.
