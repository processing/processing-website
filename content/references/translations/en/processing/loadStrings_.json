If the name of the file is used as the parameter, as in the above\n example, the file must be loaded in the sketch's \"data\" directory/folder.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer\n using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or\n a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a\n file found on a network.<br/>\n <br/>\n If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will be\n returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error\n message does not halt the program, however the <b>null</b> value may cause a\n NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned\n is <b>null</b>.<br/>\n <br/>\n Starting with Processing release 0134, all files loaded and saved by the\n Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, the default\n encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are\n moved to other platforms.\n\n ",
