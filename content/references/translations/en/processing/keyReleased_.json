See <b>key</b> and <b>keyCode</b> for more information.<br/><br/>This function can be called with or without a <b>KeyEvent</b> parameter. When called with the parameter, you get access to additional information about the keyboard event, including modifier keys that were held down.<br/><br/>Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.",
