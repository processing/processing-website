  "description": "The <b>keyTyped()</b> function is called once every time a key is pressed,\n but action keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored. <br/>\n <br/>\n Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key may\n cause multiple calls to <b>keyTyped()</b>. The rate of repeat is set by the\n operating system, and may be configured differently on each computer.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>.\n Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening\n for events.",
