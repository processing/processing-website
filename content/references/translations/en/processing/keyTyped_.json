  "description": "The <b>keyTyped()</b> function is called once every time a key is pressed, but action keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored.<br/><br/>This function can be called with or without a <b>KeyEvent</b> parameter. When called with the parameter, you get access to additional information about the keyboard event, including modifier keys that were held down.<br/><br/>Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key may cause multiple calls to <b>keyTyped()</b>. The rate of repeat is set by the operating system, and may be configured differently on each computer.<br/><br/>Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.",
