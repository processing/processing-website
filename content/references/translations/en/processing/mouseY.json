  "description": "The system variable <b>mouseY</b> always contains the current\n vertical coordinate of the mouse.\n <br/><br/>\n Note that Processing can only track the mouse position when the pointer\n is over the current window. The default value of <b>mouseY</b> is <b>0</b>,\n so <b>0</b> will be returned until the mouse moves in front of the sketch\n window. (This typically happens when a sketch is first run.)  Once the\n mouse moves away from the window, <b>mouseY</b> will continue to report\n its most recent position.",
