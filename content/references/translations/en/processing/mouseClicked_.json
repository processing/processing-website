When called with the parameter, you get access to additional information about the mouse event, including the exact coordinates, which button was clicked, and any modifier keys that were held down.<br/><br/>Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.",
