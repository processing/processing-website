While the image is loading,\n its width and height will be 0. If an error occurs while loading the image,\n its width and height will be set to -1. You'll know when the image has\n loaded properly because its <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> will be greater\n than 0. Asynchronous image loading (particularly when downloading from a\n server) can dramatically improve performance.<br/>\n <br/>\n The <b>extension</b> parameter is used to determine the image type in cases\n where the image filename does not end with a proper extension. Specify the\n extension as the second parameter to <b>requestImage()</b>.",
