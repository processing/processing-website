  "description": "This function is used to apply a regular expression to a piece of text, and\n return matching groups (elements found inside parentheses) as a String\n array. If there are no matches, a <b>null</b> value will be returned. If no groups\n are specified in the regular expression, but the sequence matches, an array\n of length 1 (with the matched text as the first element of the array) will\n be returned.<br />\n <br />\n To use the function, first check to see if the result is <b>null</b>. If the\n result is null, then the sequence did not match at all. If the sequence did\n match, an array is returned.<br />\n <br />\n If there are groups (specified by sets of parentheses) in the regular\n expression, then the contents of each will be returned in the array.\n Element [0] of a regular expression match returns the entire matching\n string, and the match groups start at element [1] (the first group is [1],\n the second [2], and so on).<br />\n <br />\n The syntax can be found in the reference for Java's <a href=\n \"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html\">Pattern</a>\n class.
