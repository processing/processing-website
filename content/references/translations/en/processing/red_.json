  "description": "Extracts the red value from a color, scaled to match current\n <b>colorMode()</b>. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful\n not to assign it to an int value.<br />\n <br />\n The <b>red()</b> function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower\n than a technique called bit shifting. When working in <b>colorMode(RGB,\n 255)</b>, you can achieve the same results as <b>red()</b> but with greater\n speed by using the right shift operator (<b>>></b>) with a bit mask. For\n example, the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the\n red value of the color value <b>c</b>:<br />\n <br />\n\n <pre>\n float r1 = red(c); // Simpler, but slower to calculate\n float r2 = c >> 16 & 0xFF; // Very fast to calculate\n </pre>",
