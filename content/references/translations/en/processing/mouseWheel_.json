The <b>getCount()</b> function\n used within <b>mouseWheel()</b> returns positive values\n when the mouse wheel is rotated down (toward the user),\n and negative values for the other direction (up or away\n from the user). On OS X with \"natural\" scrolling enabled,\n the values are opposite.\n <br/><br/>\n Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has\n <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only\n run once and then stops listening for events.",
