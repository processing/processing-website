The <b>PImage</b> class contains fields for the <b>width</b> and\n <b>height</b> of the image, as well as an array called <b>pixels[]</b> that\n contains the values for every pixel in the image. The methods described below\n allow easy access to the image's pixels and alpha channel and simplify the\n process of compositing.<br />\n <br />\n Before using the <b>pixels[]</b> array, be sure to use the\n <b>loadPixels()</b> method on the image to make sure that the pixel data is\n properly loaded.<br />\n <br />\n To create a new image, use the <b>createImage()</b> function. Do not use the\n syntax <b>new PImage()</b>.",
