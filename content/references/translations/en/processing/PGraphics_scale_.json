  "description": "Increases or decreases the size of a shape by expanding and contracting\n vertices. Objects always scale from their relative origin to the coordinate\n system. Scale values are specified as decimal percentages. For example, the\n function call <b>scale(2.0)</b> increases the dimension of a shape by\n 200%.<br />\n <br />\n Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls\n to the function multiply the effect. For example, calling <b>scale(2.0)</b>\n and then <b>scale(1.5)</b> is the same as <b>scale(3.0)</b>. If\n <b>scale()</b> is called within <b>draw()</b>, the transformation is reset\n when the loop begins again. Using this function with the <b>z</b> parameter\n requires using P3D as a parameter for <b>size()</b>, as shown in the third\n example above. This function can be further controlled with\n <b>pushMatrix()</b> and <b>popMatrix()</b>.",
