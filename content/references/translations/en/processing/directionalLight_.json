  "description": "Adds a directional light. Directional light comes from one direction and\n is stronger when hitting a surface squarely and weaker if it hits at a a\n gentle angle. After hitting a surface, a directional lights scatters in\n all directions. Lights need to be included in the <b>draw()</b> to\n remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the\n <b>setup()</b> of a looping program will cause them to only have an\n effect the first time through the loop. The affect of the <b>v1</b>,\n <b>v2</b>, and <b>v3</b> parameters is determined by the current color\n mode. The <b>nx</b>, <b>ny</b>, and <b>nz</b> parameters specify the\n direction the light is facing. For example, setting <b>ny</b> to -1 will\n cause the geometry to be lit from below (the light is facing directly upward).",
