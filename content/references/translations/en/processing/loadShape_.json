  "description": "Loads geometry into a variable of type <b>PShape</b>. SVG and OBJ\n files may be loaded. To load correctly, the file must be located\n in the data directory of the current sketch. In most cases,\n <b>loadShape()</b> should be used inside <b>setup()</b> because\n loading shapes inside <b>draw()</b> will reduce the speed of a sketch.<br/>\n <br/>\n Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local\n computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on\n Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename\n parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.<br/>\n <br/>\n If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will\n be returned and an error message will be printed to the console.\n The error message does not halt the program, however the null value\n may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether\n the value returned is null.<br/>",
