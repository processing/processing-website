  "description": "The <b>delay()</b> function causes the program to halt for a specified time.\n Delay times are specified in thousandths of a second. For example,\n running <b>delay(3000)</b> will stop the program for three seconds and\n <b>delay(500)</b> will stop the program for a half-second.\n <p/>\n The screen only updates when the end of <b>draw()</b> is reached, so <b>delay()</b>\n cannot be used to slow down drawing. For instance, you cannot use <b>delay()</b>\n to control the timing of an animation.\n <p/>\n The <b>delay()</b> function should only be used for pausing scripts (i.e.\n a script that needs to pause a few seconds before attempting a download,\n or a sketch that needs to wait a few milliseconds before reading from\n the serial port).",
