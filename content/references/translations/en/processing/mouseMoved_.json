(If a button <i>is</i> being pressed, <b>mouseDragged()</b> is called instead.)<br/><br/>This function can be called with or without a <b>MouseEvent</b> parameter. When called with the parameter, you get access to additional information about the mouse event, including the exact coordinates and any modifier keys that were held down.<br/><br/>Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.",
