  "description": "The <b>pop()</b> function restores the previous drawing style\n settings and transformations after <b>push()</b> has changed them.\n Note that these functions are always used together. They allow\n you to change the style and transformation settings and later\n return to what you had. When a new state is started with push(),\n it builds on the current style and transform information.\n <br />\n <br />\n <b>push()</b> stores information related to the current\n transformation state and style settings controlled by the\n following functions: <b>rotate()</b>, <b>translate()</b>,\n <b>scale()</b>, <b>fill()</b>, <b>stroke()</b>, <b>tint()</b>,\n <b>strokeWeight()</b>, <b>strokeCap()</b>, <b>strokeJoin()</b>,\n <b>imageMode()</b>, <b>rectMode()</b>, <b>ellipseMode()</b>,\n <b>colorMode()</b>, <b>textAlign()</b>, <b>textFont()</b>,\n <b>textMode()</b>, <b>textSize()</b>, <b>textLeading()</b>.<br />\n <br />\n The <b>push()</b> and <b>pop()</b> functions were added with\n Processing 3.5. They can be used in place of <b>pushMatrix()</b>,\n <b>popMatrix()</b>, <b>pushStyles()</b>, and <b>popStyles()</b>.\n The difference is that push() and pop() control both the\n transformations (rotate, scale, translate) and the drawing styles\n at the same time.",
