  "description": "Opens a new file and all subsequent drawing functions are echoed to this\n file as well as the display window. The <b>beginRecord()</b> function\n requires two parameters, the first is the renderer and the second is the\n file name. This function is always used with <b>endRecord()</b> to stop the\n recording process and close the file. <br/>\n <br/>\n Note that <b>beginRecord()</b> will only pick up any settings that happen\n after it has been called. For instance, if you call <b>textFont()</b>\n before <b>beginRecord()</b>, then that font will not be set for the file\n that you're recording to. <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>beginRecord()</b> works only with the PDF and SVG renderers.",
