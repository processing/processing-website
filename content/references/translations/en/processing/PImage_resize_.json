  "description": "Resize the image to a new width and height. To make the image scale\n proportionally, use 0 as the value for the <b>wide</b> or <b>high</b>\n parameter. For instance, to make the width of an image 150 pixels, and\n change the height using the same proportion, use <b>resize(150, 0)</b>.<br/>\n <br/>\n Even though a PGraphics is technically a <b>PImage</b>, it is not possible to\n rescale the image data found in a <b>PGraphics</b>. (It's simply not possible\n to do this consistently across renderers: technically infeasible with\n P3D, or what would it even do with PDF?) If you want to resize <b>PGraphics</b>\n content, first get a copy of its image data using the <b>get()</b>\n method, and call <b>resize()</b> on the PImage that is returned.",
