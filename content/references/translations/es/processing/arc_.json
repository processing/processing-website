  "description": "Draws an arc to the screen. Arcs are drawn along the outer edge of an ellipse\n defined by the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>d</b> parameters. The\n origin of the arc's ellipse may be changed with the <b>ellipseMode()</b>\n function. Use the <b>start</b> and <b>stop</b> parameters to specify the\n angles (in radians) at which to draw the arc. The start/stop values must be\n in clockwise order. <br />\n <br />\n There are three ways to draw an arc; the rendering technique used is defined\n by the optional seventh parameter. The three options, depicted in the above\n examples, are PIE, OPEN, and CHORD. The default mode is the OPEN stroke with\n a PIE fill. <br />\n <br />\n In some cases, the <b>arc()</b> function isn't accurate enough for smooth\n drawing. For example, the shape may jitter on screen when rotating slowly. If\n you're having an issue with how arcs are rendered, you'll need to draw the\n arc yourself with <b>beginShape()</b>/<b>endShape()</b> or a <b>PShape</b>.",
