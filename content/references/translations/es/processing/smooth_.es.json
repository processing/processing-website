  "description": "Draws all geometry with smooth (anti-aliased) edges.\n This behavior is the default, so <b>smooth()</b> only needs\n to be used when a program needs to set the smoothing\n in a different way. The level parameter increases\n the amount of smoothness. This is the level of over\n sampling applied to the graphics buffer.\n\n With the P2D and P3D renderers, <b>smooth(2)</b> is the\n default, this is called \"2x anti-aliasing.\" The code\n <b>smooth(4)</b> is used for 4x anti-aliasing and <b>smooth(8)</b>\n is specified for \"8x anti-aliasing.\" The maximum\n anti-aliasing level is determined by the hardware of\n the machine that is running the software, so <b>smooth(4)</b>\n and <b>smooth(8)</b> will not work with every computer.\n\n The default renderer uses <b>smooth(3)</b> by default. This\n is bicubic smoothing. The other option for the default\n renderer is <b>smooth(2)</b>, which is bilinear smoothing.\n\n With Processing 3.0, <b>smooth()</b> is different than before.\n It was common to use <b>smooth()</b> and <b>noSmooth()</b> to turn on\n and off antialiasing within a sketch. Now, because of\n how the software has changed, <b>smooth()</b> can only be set\n once within a sketch. It can be used either at the top\n of a sketch without a <b>setup()</b>, or after the <b>size()</b>\n function when used in a sketch with <b>setup()</b>. The\n <b>noSmooth()</b> function also follows the same rules.\n\n When <b>smooth()</b> is used with a PGraphics object, it should\n be run right after the object is created with\n <b>createGraphics()</b>, as shown in the Reference in the third\n example.",
