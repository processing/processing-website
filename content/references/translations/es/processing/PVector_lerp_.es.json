  "description": "Calculates linear interpolation from one vector to another vector. (Just like\n regular <b>lerp()</b>, but for vectors.)<br />\n <br />\n Note that there is one <em>static</em> version of this method, and two\n <em>non-static</em> versions. The static version, <b>lerp(v1, v2, amt)</b> is\n given the two vectors to interpolate and returns a new PVector object. The\n static version is used by referencing the PVector class directly. (See the\n middle example above.) The non-static versions, <b>lerp(v, amt)</b> and\n <b>lerp(x, y, z, amt)</b>, do not create a new PVector, but transform the\n values of the <b>PVector</b> on which they are called. These non-static versions\n perform the same operation, but the former takes another vector as input,\n while the latter takes three float values. (See the top and bottom examples\n above, respectively.)",
