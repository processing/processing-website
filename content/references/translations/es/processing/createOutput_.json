  "description": "Similar to <b>createInput()</b>, this creates a Java <b>OutputStream</b>\n for a given filename or path. The file will be created in the sketch\n folder, or in the same folder as an exported application. <br />\n <br />\n If the path does not exist, intermediate folders will be created. If an\n exception occurs, it will be printed to the console, and <b>null</b> will\n be returned. <br />\n <br />\n This function is a convenience over the Java approach that requires you to\n 1) create a FileOutputStream object, 2) determine the exact file location,\n and 3) handle exceptions. Exceptions are handled internally by the\n function, which is more appropriate for \"sketch\" projects. <br />\n <br />\n If the output filename ends with <b>.gz</b>, the output will be\n automatically GZIP compressed as it is written.",
