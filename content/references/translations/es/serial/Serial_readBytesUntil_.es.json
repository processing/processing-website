  "description": "Reads from the port into a buffer of bytes up to and including a particular character. If the \n character isn't in the buffer, <b>null</b> is returned. The version with without the \n <b>byteBuffer</b> parameter returns a byte array of all data up to and including the \n <b>interesting</b> byte. This is not efficient, but is easy to use. The version with the \n <b>byteBuffer</b> parameter is more memory and time efficient. It grabs the data in the buffer \n and puts it into the byte array passed in and returns an int value for the number of bytes read. \n If the byte buffer is not large enough, -1 is returned and an error is printed to the message \n area. If nothing is in the buffer, 0 is returned.",
