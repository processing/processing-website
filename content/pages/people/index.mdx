## Project Leads

[Ben Fry](https://benfry.com/) and [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/) started Processing in Spring 2001 and obsessively worked on it for over twenty years. In 2012, they established the Processing Foundation along with [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/), who formally joined as the third project lead. In August 2022, [Raphaël de Courville](https://twitter.com/sableraph) joined full-time as Processing Community Lead, under Casey Reas’ mentorship. In 2023, Ben, Casey, and Dan officially stepped down from their active roles as project leads, marking the beginning of a new era for Processing under the stewardship of the Processing Foundation.

## Libraries, Tools

The core Processing software is augmented by [libraries](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/), [modes](https://processing.org/reference/tools/modes/), and [tools](https://processing.org/reference/tools/) contributed by the community. These contributions expand Processing's capabilities. For example, see how Karsten Schmidt transformed Processing with toxiclibs, or how Jeongin Lee added machine learning via her Creative Machine library.

## Website and Design

[Design Systems International](https://designsystems.international/) designed and built the current website and the new Processing family of logos through a year of dedicated volunteer work. A remarkable group of volunteers converted all of the content from the prior Processing website to the new formats. A hearty round of applause for:
